# SDL2

This is a copy of the SDL source code (version 2.0.22) with the premake5 build system added. It was loosely based on the [SDL2 copy with premake][1], the difference is only in the SDL version and the directory structure.

The official source release of SDL can be found [here][1]. 

## Building
The premake files only support Windows


## License
This project is licenced under the [zlib licence][3], since it is a modified version of SDL2.
